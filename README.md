# Sales Visualization and Analysis with Power BI
In my repository, I have shared a project focused on analyzing a sales database through visualization and data analysis tools. To create the visualizations, I utilized Microsoft Power BI, while also leveraging the query tool in Power BI for data analysis. The project provides insights into sales trends, patterns, and performance, and serves as a helpful reference for those interested in using these tools for data analysis and visualization in the sales domain.
